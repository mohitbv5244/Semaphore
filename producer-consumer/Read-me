The producer-consumer problem is solved using a semaphore.
If a task wants to use the semaphore,it needs to lock the semaphore.
After using the semaphore, we need to realease the semaphore.

Initially, the buffer is empty. So the ull is 0 and empty is 5.
Here empty defines the number of values that can be in the Queue.

When the producer produces the value, first, we need to lock the 
semeaphore then increment the full value and decrement the empty value,
produce the value and realease the semaphore.

When the consumer consumes the value, first, we need to lock the 
semeaphore then decrement the full value and increment the empty value,
consume the value and realease the semaphore.
